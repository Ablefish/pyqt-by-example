PyQt By Example: Session 5

Requirements
============

If you have not done it yet, please check the previous sessions:
    
* `Session 1`_

* `Session 2`_

* `Session 3`_

* `Session 4`_

All files for this session are here: `Session 5 at GitHub`_. You can use them, or you can follow these instructions starting with the files from `Session 4`_ and see how well you worked!

Dialog
======

When we finished `session 4`_ we had a TODO application that was able of displaying your task list, and deleting a task, and had the proper UI for that.

   A very limited application

The obvious missing pieces are creating and modifying tasks, and that's what we will be implementing today.

But first, let's consider a course of action, because there are several different ways to do this, and trying to implement something you have not thought about sucks.

Inline Editing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the user clicks (or double-clicks?) on a task, he could start editing the task properties in the task item itself.

Examples of this model of interaction include:
    
* Spreadsheets

* File renaming in some file managers

* Todo lists in some websites

The good: 

    * Minimal user interface.
    
    * Obvious if the user knows about it.
    
    * Direct manipulation of the task item is a good metaphor.
    
    * Works well in small screens (netbooks, phones)
    
The bad:
    
    * It's not trivial to implement, for example, a due date/time editor this way (feel free to prove me wrong ;-)
    
    * I don't like it much for task addition. Using this paradigm usually means you create   a task using placeholders like "New Task" and then need to edit it. I prefer if the user creates the tasks "fully fledged".
    

So, maybe it's a good idea to implement this, but I am fully convinced.

Editor Dialog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the user triggers the "edit task" action, a dialog pops up where he can set the task's properties.

Examples of this model of interaction:
    
* File properties in most file managers.

* Configuration dialogs in most applications.

The good:
    
    * A separate dialog allows use of a richer UI, because you are not limited by the small space used for inline editing.
    
    * The same dialog can be used for task creating with minimal changes.
    
    * It would let me show you how to create a proper dialog ;-)

The bad:
    
    * Breaks the metaphor. Only do that `when it makes sense`_
    
    * Popup dialogs often obscure the main window. Then if you need to check a date from another task, you need to move the dialog aside.
    
    * Old fashioned?
    
All in all, not a fan of this option as the main mechanism for task editing.

Sliding Panels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
This is a more modern interaction model: when a task editing action is triggered, a gadget slides into view from one of the window edges, containing the editing widgets.

Examples of this interaction:
    
* Firefox's search dialog (Thankfully many apps are using this now, popup search dialogs suck)

* Boxee's menu

* Some phone interfaces

The good:
    
    * Rich UI like in a dialog
    
    * Doesn't obscure the main window
   
    * Modern
    
    * Works for adding tasks as well
    
The bad:
    
    * Could be confusing?

    * Could not work great in small screens (needs testing!)

I think I like this option better. It should also work well as a teaching aid, since we will need to learn to do many things to make it work correctly!

Creating the Form
-----------------

As usual when we do UI work, we start with designer. This time, we will not create a Main Window, but a Widget.
